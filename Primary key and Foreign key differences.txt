Primary key: A primary key is a special attribute or field within a database table that uniquely identifies each record or row in that table. It acts as a distinctive label for every information stored in the table, ensuring that no two records have the same identifier. This unique identification helps locate, access, and manipulate specific data within the table.Only one primary key can exist per table. It does not allow null values.Foreign key:  A foreign key is a relational database theory that connects and establishes relationships among different tables by referring to the primary key of another table. This linking enables sharing and exchanging data between the two tables. The purpose of using foreign keys is to enforce referential integrity and maintain data consistency across tables. It ensures that the values stored in the foreign key field of one table are also present in the primary key field of another table. Multiple foreign keys can exist per table. It can contain null values.Primary and Foreign keys in mavenmovies database:table actor - primary key: actor_idtable actor_award - primary key: actor_award_id Foriegn key: actor_idtable address - primary key: address_id Foriegn key: city_idtable advisor - primary key: advisor_idtable category - primary key: category_idtable city- primary key: city_id Foreign key: country_idtable country- primary key: country_idtable customer - primary key: customer_id Foreign key: store_id, address_idtable film - primary key: film_id Foreign key: language_idtable film_actor - primary key: film_id Foreign key: actor_idtable film_category - primary key: film_id Foreign key: category_idtable film_text - primary key: film_idtable inventory - Primary key: inventory_id Foreign key: film_id, store_idtable investor - primary key: investor_idtable language - primary key: language_idtable payment - primary key: payment_id Foreign key: customer_id, staff_id, rental_idtable rental - primary key: rental_id Foreign key: inventory_id, customer_id, staff_idtable staff - primary key: staff_id Foreign key: store_idtable store - primary key: store_id
